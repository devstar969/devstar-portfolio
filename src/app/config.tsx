            <p>
                Hi! I'm Alvin, a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> who started coding in <strong>2023</strong>. Since then, I've built <strong>streaming platforms</strong>, <strong>blogs</strong>, and <strong>e-commerce sites</strong>. Whether it‚Äôs front-end finesse or back-end logic, I love bringing ideas to life on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I‚Äôve been experimenting with <strong>Framer Motion</strong> for smooth animations and the <strong>OpenAI API</strong> for cool AI projects. From custom <strong>APIs with Express</strong> to impressive interfaces with <strong>Next.js</strong>‚ÄîI‚Äôve got it covered, and I also manage <strong>WordPress</strong> sites like a pro.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me playing <strong>Dota 2</strong>, cooking up new recipes, or streaming on <strong>Kick</strong>. Let's connect‚ÄîI'd love to help with your next <strong>website</strong> or <strong>API</strong> project!
            </p>
